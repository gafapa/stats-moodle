# Architecture

## Entry Point

- `main.py` starts the CustomTkinter application and loads `MoodleAnalyzerApp`.

## Core Modules

- `src/ui.py`: application UI, connection workflow, course selection, dashboards, and report actions.
- `src/moodle_client.py`: Moodle REST client, token-based access, and token generation from credentials.
- `src/data_collector.py`: gathers course, user, submission, forum, quiz, and completion data from Moodle.
- `src/analyzer.py`: computes course and student metrics, passing-threshold-aware predictions, and risk indicators.
- `src/report_agent.py`: generates AI-assisted narrative reports.
- `src/profiles.py`: persists local connection profiles.
- `src/i18n.py`: runtime translation layer, language persistence, and UI/chart text translation.
- `website/`: static HTML/CSS page that presents the project, its purpose, and its workflow.
- `prepare_web_release.bat`: creates `deploy/webserver/` with the website assets and the standalone executable under `downloads/` for server upload.

## Authentication Flow

1. User enters Moodle URL.
2. User either:
   - provides an existing token, or
   - provides username and password.
   The token generation action is shown only when the token field is empty.
3. If the token is missing, the UI asks `MoodleClient.from_credentials(...)` to request a token from:
   - `/login/token.php`
   - `service=moodle_mobile_app`
4. The returned token is reused for the active session and can be stored in the local profile.
5. Passwords are cleared after successful token generation or connection.

## Session Flow

1. The first screen collects the UI language, Moodle URL, and authentication method.
2. After a successful connection, the user reaches course selection.
3. Course selection also exposes the configurable passing threshold, which defaults to `50%`.
4. The selected threshold is stored in the app session and passed into the analysis pipeline.
5. Dashboard, student detail views, charts, and reports consume the same analysis object so pass/fail logic stays consistent across the UI.
6. Asynchronous course-list loads are request-scoped so stale responses do not overwrite the currently selected mode or analysis tab.

## Local Persistence

- Profiles are stored in `~/.moodle_analyzer/profiles.json`.
- AI settings are stored in `~/.moodle_analyzer/ai_settings.json`.
- UI language settings are stored in `~/.moodle_analyzer/ui_settings.json`.

## Web Distribution

- The public website links to `./downloads/MoodleAnalyzer.exe` as the stable download path for the standalone Windows build.
- `prepare_web_release.bat` assembles a deployable bundle that mirrors that structure so the web root can be uploaded without manual rearrangement.

## Internationalization

- The desktop app supports Spanish, Galician, English, French, German, Catalan, and Basque.
- The static website uses client-side translations for the same languages.
- Report prompts adapt the requested report language to the active UI language.
- UI and website strings are stored as UTF-8 source text in `src/i18n.py` and `website/app.js` to avoid encoding artifacts in labels and messages.
- The desktop translation runtime resolves icon-prefixed labels and dynamic status lines used in loading states, charts, and reports.
- Student detail sections, including alert/recommendation panels and AI-report controls, use the same runtime translation layer instead of local hardcoded labels.
- Analyzer-generated recommendation sentences and risk-factor messages are covered through pattern-based runtime translations, so student alert cards remain localized too.
- The desktop language is selected from the initial connection screen; the main shell does not expose an in-session language switcher.

## Adaptive Analysis

- Student and course metrics are availability-aware: forums, assignments, quizzes, and completion metrics are only evaluated when that component exists in the course.
- Aggregated course metrics expose component availability flags so the UI can suppress unsupported summary rows and chart tabs.
- Course and student chart builders also drop unavailable dimensions to avoid presenting zero-valued placeholders as real behavior.
- The analysis pipeline also carries a configurable passing grade threshold, selected on the course selection screen and defaulted to `50%`.
- That threshold is propagated into the analyzer, chart builders, student detail indicators, and AI-report context so grade-based interpretations stay consistent.
- Risk scoring uses conservative cutoffs so students with grades comfortably above the passing threshold are not escalated to medium risk by only mild warning signals.
- Loading and progress messages shown during course retrieval and analysis are translated through the same runtime language layer used by the rest of the UI.

## Website And Distribution

- `website/index.html` provides the public landing page for the project.
- `website/app.js` contains the website translation dictionaries and current product description.
- The website text now reflects:
  - configurable pass threshold selection before analysis
  - adaptive omission of metrics that do not apply to the selected course
  - conservative risk interpretation for students whose grades are clearly above the pass threshold
- `prepare_web_release.bat` rebuilds `deploy/webserver/` so the upload bundle always contains the latest website assets and download link target.

## Testing

- Unit tests live in `tests/`.
- Authentication coverage includes token generation and profile persistence without storing passwords.
- Regression coverage includes threshold-aware risk behavior and adaptive analysis for courses without specific Moodle components.
